How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fill in your answer here

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
    - git log will give you a log of all the commits whereas git diff will show you the difference between 2 commits when you type git diff with the 2 ids ex. git diff 4035769377cce96a88d5c1167079e12f30492391 4035769377cce96a88d5c1167079e12f30492391 (those are the same commits)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that

    Fill in your answer here
